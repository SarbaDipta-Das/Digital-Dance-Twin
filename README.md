# Digital-Dance-Twin
This Python script uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to process a dance video, detecting human poses frame by frame. It visualizes 2D pose landmarks with glowing effects and dynamically plots 3D skeletons in real time using Matplotlib, creating an interactive motion capture-style visualization.
